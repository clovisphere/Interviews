#  Find Pair Whose Sum Equals Target

Given two arrays of N size and a target, write a function that
returns a pair (made up of elements from the two arrays) whose sum is equal to the target, if no
pair exist, return null.

```
E.g

(a) [18, 3, 2, 11] (b) [6, 1, 3, 0] ~> target: 18

Result: (18, 0)
```
