#  Find Pair Whose Sum Equals Target

Given two arrays of N size and a target, write a function that
returns a pair whose sum is equal to the target, if no
pair exist, return null.

**Note**: the **pair** is built using element from the two arrays.
```
E.g

(a) [18, 3, 2, 11] (b) [6, 1, 3, 0] ~> target: 18

Result: (18, 0)

(b) [1, 3, 9] (b) [1, 1, 1] ~> target: 9

Result: None
```
