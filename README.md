# Interviews
Answers to technical questions I see here and there (thanks to the internet); note that (some) solution(s) may contain *bugs* (sorry!) or might not be optimized (enough). My aim is not to give the (most) ideal solution, oh no.. I use these interview questions to practice my problem-solving, that's all!
