1. You are given a string S composed of characters A to Z, formulate a function that transforms a given string by changing each letter as follows: ‘a’ becomes ‘z’, ‘b’ becomes ‘y’, ‘c’ becomes ‘x’, e.t.c

2. You a given a string S of any length, formulate a function that splits the strings into substrings of a given length N and returns the substrings in a list. If the length of S is not evenly divisible by N, it is acceptable to have the last substring with a length less than N, see example below.

3. Assume you have a sensor that reports temperature readings periodically. The readings are stored as 2 lists of equal length; List T composed of timestamps for each reading and list R composed of temperature readings for each of the matching timestamps. Your goal is to identify timestamps at which a certain threshold temperature Q was crossed.

Formulate a function that takes lists T and R and a threshold temperature Q and returns a list of timestamps where Q was exceeded. Note that you should only return timestamps representing a datapoint that crosses the threshold, and ignore those that remain above the threshold.

4. You are given a list P of average share prices for a particular stock for each day in a given year. Your goal is to buy 1 share and later sell it at maximum profit. Formulate a function that takes list P and returns the best day to buy (B) and the best day to sell (S). You have to buy the share before you can later sell it.

5. Please see the code below which moves a ball through 2D space. You may use and edit *either* the Python or Java code below, whichever you are more comfortable with.

This code defines a wall, but currently allows the ball to pass through it.  

Please adjust the code so that the ball bounces back if it contacts the vertical wall.  Ignore physics (friction, gravity, etc).
